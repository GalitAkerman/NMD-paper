Here includes the raw data, coding, results and table for the paper.

Eight R scripts are included in the R subdirectory. You can run them by the order from 01_PANCAN_data.R. The 00_PANCAN_function.R contains the functions that are used in the prediction or analysis. The 01_PANCAN_data.R is about loading data and preprocessing. The 02_PANCAN_classify.R is about prediction of NMD-elicit mutations. The 06_PANCAN_figures_manuscript.R generates the figures in the manuscript, and the 07_PANCAN_supplementary_figures.R generates the supplementary figures.
